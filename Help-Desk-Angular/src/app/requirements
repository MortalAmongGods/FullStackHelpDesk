Corn:

Kyle: At least 1 API service to access the backend program

Rachel: Create at least three components and routing between them and app.module.html

       Two databases: In-Flight DB
                         Completed DB
                         
          DB Columns: 
                      ID
                      Request Title*
                      Submitter Name*
                      Problem*
                      Solution*
                      Priority Level (number)*
                      
                      Time Stamp Request Submitted (system does this when user submits request)
                      
                      Assigned To - Completed by the person who did the work, not the submiter
                      Resolution Status (i.e. Completed, Not Completed, In Progress)
                      Favorited (boolean y/n) - Completed by the person who did the work, not the submiter
                      Time Stamp Request Resolved (system does this when the worker resolves the request)
                      
          Methods:
                      HTTPGET:             Get All Requests
                      HTTPGET:             Get Single Request
                      HTTPPOST:            New Request 
                      HTTPPOST/HTTPDELETE: Complete Request - this will add to completed DB and remove from in-flight DB 
                      HTTPPATCH:           Favorite request - This will modify the angular view later
                      HTTPPATCH:           Update Ticket with worker information
                      HTTPGET:             Get All Favorited Requests
          
          Component Needed:
                      Nav-Bar
                            Routing to each of the below components
                      All Tickets In Flight
                      All Tickets Completed
                      Favorite Ticket
                      Single Ticket (user will to be able update ticket (i.e. close, assign to, reopen))
                      New Request (needs to be a form)
                      Log-In Screen (hold off until we figure out later in week)
